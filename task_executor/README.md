# Task Executor

This package executes a pick-and-place task. When there is a failure, it calls sends a request to an arbitrator module to help it decide who to contact, and then it sends a request to a help interface. When the interface signals a completion, the task execution resumes

## Notes

1. There are two broad classes of data: database data items and task definitions. The former are data items such as details of objects, locations on the map, arm positions, etc. The latter are task definitions.
1. All task definitions deal with three types of steps: tasks, actions, and ops. Actions are the lowest level of a task hierarchy that interface with a known ROS action server or service. Tasks are YAML definitions that should ultimately be generated by CodeIt! (or something similar). ops include near-instantaneous variable renaming, etc.
1. Actions **cannot** be performed concurrently at this time. However, it *should* be a trivial change to the code if we want to allow concurrent execution of actions.
