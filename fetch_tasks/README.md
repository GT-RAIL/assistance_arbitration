# Fetch Tasks

**NOTE**: Some of the code here is now broken because of updates to the external `isolation` package.

An example package using the executive system described in this repository. Contains primitive actions, etc. that can be used on the Fetch robot without needing to run any additional nodes.

By default the code in this repository is setup to perform the task described in [TODO-AAAI-Paper](#).
