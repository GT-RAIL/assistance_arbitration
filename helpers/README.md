# Helpers

These are helper packages for the task execution system that are not critical to the executive level itself. Most of the packages here provide additional utilities at the behaviour level.

- [`simulation_helpers`](simulation_helpers/) - Nodes and utilities to help in bringing the simulation of the robot to parity with the real robot
- [`sound_interface`](sound_interface/) - Custom sound server that doesn't mysteriously hang, and also contains utlities to for robot beeps and TTS
