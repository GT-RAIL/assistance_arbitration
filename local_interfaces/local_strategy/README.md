# Local Strategy

This package coordinates the different methods of soliciting help from a local human (once such a person is identified).

The current method of soliciting help:

1. Looks around for a person (potentially forever)
1. Enters compliant mode - all joints can be moved by a human.
1. When a person is found, starts a dialogue:
    1. Tells the person what failed and the likely cause of that failure.
    1. Can respond to questions of what else might have failed.
    1. Can explain that safety is the reason we're in compliant mode.
1. When person indicates that the problem should be resolved, chirp happily and return.
